### ContractNLI: A Dataset for Document-level Natural Language Inference for Contracts
**URL**: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.01799.pdf

**Abstract**: Reviewing contracts is a time-consuming pro- cedure that incurs large expenses to companies and social inequality to those who cannot af- ford it. In this work, we propose document- level natural language inference (NLI) for con- tracts, a novel, real-world application of NLI that addresses such problems. In this task, a system is given a set of hypotheses (such as “Some obligations of Agreement may survive termination.”) and a contract, and it is asked to classify whether each hypothesis is entailed by, contradicting to or not mentioned by (neu- tral to) the contract as well as identifying ev- idence for the decision as spans in the con- tract. We annotated and release the largest cor- pus to date consisting of 607 annotated con- tracts. We then show that existing models fail badly on our task and introduce a strong baseline, which (1) models evidence identifi- cation as multi-label classification over spans instead of trying to predict start and end to- kens, and (2) employs more sophisticated con- text segmentation for dealing with long docu- ments. We also show that linguistic character- istics of contracts, such as negations by excep- tions, are contributing to the difficulty of this task and that there is much room for improve- ment.
