### Deep contextualized word representations (ELMo, AllenInst w/ Zettlemoyer)
https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05365  
https://allennlp.org/elmo  
- perhaps this is combined with (or replaced by?): Contextual String Embeddings for Sequence Labeling (which Ajay@NAACL reports is simpler and more sample efficient)
