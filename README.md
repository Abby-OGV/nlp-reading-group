# nlp-reading-group

A Computational Linguistics/NLP reading group at the University of Arizona.

### [Spring 2017 Reading Schedule](https://github.com/clulab/nlp-reading-group/wiki/Spring-2017-Reading-Schedule)

The group will be meeting nearly every Friday during the Spring 2017 semester on the ninth floor of [Gould-Simpson](http://map.arizona.edu) from 2-3PM in room 906.  The intention is to wrap up in time to make the Linguistics colloquium. 

Everyone is welcome to participate (faculty and students alike).  The only expectation is that participants read the paper scheduled for that week ahead of time.
