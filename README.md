# nlp-reading-group

A Computational Linguistics/NLP reading group at the University of Arizona.

## [Fall 2015 Reading Schedule](https://github.com/clulab/nlp-reading-group/wiki/Fall-2015-Reading-Schedule)

The group will be meeting nearly every Friday during the Fall 2015 semester on the ninth floor of [Gould-Simpson](http://map.arizona.edu) from 2-3PM (see the schedule for the room number for each meeting).  The intention is to wrap up in time to make the Linguistics colloquium.  

Everyone is welcome to participate (faculty and students alike).  The only expectation is that participants read the paper scheduled for that week ahead of time.
